# Why not update/updated or just use a level script? Because 
# due to execution order, only the ondraw event captures
# sprite que correctly. Attempting to capture and draw the
# sprite que to screens with other events may produce odd
# effects. The screen contents may appear to swap positions
# on Z axis or disappear when paused.
